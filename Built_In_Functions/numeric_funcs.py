x = '47'
y = int(x)#constructor for the int type and return int from another type, hence changing the data type from string to integer
# we have methods like divmod, complex,,,more info refer to docs.python.org

print(f'x is {type(x)}')
print(f'x is {x}')
print(f'y is {type(y)}')
print(f'y is {y}')
#RESULT
#x is <class 'str'>
# x is 47
# y is <class 'int'>
# y is 47
